**pictures of formal mathematical equations**

Equations are full of our study life. Though the knowledge of a specific topic is easy to understand, remembering them for a long time seems to be a hard work.

A small picture which preserve the minimum pivotal information will help us remember or review those confused notions. Since a person has learnt it to some extent, the knowledge will be easier to reproduce.

To show the math process better, mathematica notebook is used in this repo.
